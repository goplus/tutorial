// There are two floating point types in XGo, float32 and float64
// Floating point literals have a default type of float64.
//
// A floating-point number cannot represent a decimal value exactly. Do not use them to
// represent money or any other value that must have an exact decimal representation!
//
// While you can use == and != to compare floats, donâ€™t do it. Due to the
// inexact nature of floats, two floating point values might not be equal when you
// think they should be. Instead, define a minimum allowed variance and see if the
// difference between two floats is less than that. This minimum value (sometimes
// called epsilon) depends on what your accuracy needs are;
//
// Float literals can also be declared as a power of ten and dividing a float variable set to 0 by 0 returns NaN (Not a Number).

f0 := 42e1   // 420
f1 := 123e-2 // 1.23
f2 := 456e+2 // 45600
