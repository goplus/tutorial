# Slice
// An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.
//
// The type []T is a slice with elements of type T.
//
// A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon: a[low : high]. This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.
