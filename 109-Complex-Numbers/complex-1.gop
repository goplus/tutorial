# Initializing Complex Numbers
// There are two complex types in XGo. The complex64 and the complex128.
// Initializing complex numbers is really easy. You can use the constructor or the initialization syntax as well.

c1 := complex(10, 11) // constructor init
c2 := 10 + 11i        // complex number init syntax
println c1, c2
