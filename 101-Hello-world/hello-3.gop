# The third type: software engineering style

package main

func main() {
	println("Hello world")
}

// This is a standard software engineering-based writing method that has been inherited from
// Go. It is not easy for beginners to understand, because they need to understand what is a
// function (func) and what is a package (package). Of course, it also has its benefits,
// starting to allow you to establish some basic logic for functional decomposition and team
// collaboration.

// So, how do you try to play XGo?

// The simplest, go directly to XGo Playground to play:

// * https://play.xgo.dev

// When learning basic grammar in the early days, it can actually be done in this way.

// How to install XGo to play locally? We will talk about this topic later.
