# break and continue
// How do you get out of an infinite for loop without using the keyboard or
// turning off your computer? That’s the job of the break statement. It exits the
// loop immediately, just like the break statement in other languages. Of course,
// you can use break with any for statement, not just the infinite for statement.
//
// XGo also includes the continue keyword, which skips over rest of the body of a
// for loop and proceeds directly to the next iteration. Technically, you don’t need
// a continue statement.

for i := 1; i <= 100; i++ {
	if i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0 {
		println("FizzBuzz")
		continue
	}
	if i%3 == 0 {
		println("Fizz")
		continue
	}
	if i%5 == 0 {
		println("Buzz")
		break
	}
	println(i)
}
