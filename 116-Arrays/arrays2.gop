# Declaration of multidimensional arrays

// You can declare a matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns like this
var matrix [2][2]int
println matrix
// If you need to declare more dimensions, you can extend them yourself, such as declaring a 2*2*3 three-dimensional array
var threeDimensionalArray [2][2][3]int
println threeDimensionalArray
