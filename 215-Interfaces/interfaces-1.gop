// First, we define a very simple interface on geometry, containing the two most basic
// interface methods - calculating the area and calculating the perimeter - with the following code:
type geometry interface {
	area() float64
	perim() float64
}

// Next, we define two structs, a rectangular struct and a circular Rectangular
// struct, with the following code:
type rect struct {
	width  float64
	height float64
}

type circle struct {
	radius float64
}

// Then implement the interface methods defined above respectively, and the code
// related to the rectangular structure is as follows:
func (c circle) area() float64 {
	return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}

func (c circle) perim() float64 {
	return 2 * math.Pi * c.radius
}
