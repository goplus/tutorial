// XGo has various value types including strings,
// integers, floats, booleans, etc.

// Here are a few basic examples.

// Strings, which can be added together with `+`.
println "X"+"Go"

// Integers and floats.
println "1+1 =", 1+1
println "7.0/3.0 =", 7.0/3.0

// Booleans, with boolean operators as you'd expect.
println true && false
println true || false
println !true
