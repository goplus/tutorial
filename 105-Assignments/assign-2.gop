# `=` vs `:=`

// := is used for declaring and initializing. Multiple variables can be declared and intialized at one line.
age := 21 // age is declared and initialized to 21
println age

a, b := 0, 1 // multiple variables can be declared and intialized at one line.
a, b = b, a
println a, b // 1, 0
