// Branching with `if` and `else` in Go+ is
// straight-forward.

// Here's a basic example.
if 7%2 == 0 {
	println "7 is even"
} else {
	println "7 is odd"
}

// You can have an `if` statement without an else.
if 8%4 == 0 {
	println "8 is divisible by 4"
}

// A statement can precede conditionals; any variables
// declared in this statement are available in all
// branches.
if num := 9; num < 0 {
	println num, "is negative"
} else if num < 10 {
	println num, "has 1 digit"
} else {
	println num, "has multiple digits"
}

// Note that you don't need parentheses around conditions
// in Go+, but that the braces are required.
